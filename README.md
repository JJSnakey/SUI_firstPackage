##Inspiration

In the United States, only 2 to 7 percent of children have been diagnosed with gambling addiction. This is likely because casinos don't have cool video games like Fortnite. What an untapped market! Introducing Hungry Hungry Hipp- erm... I mean, Hungry Hungry Alligators! 

##Details

Hungry Hungry Alligators is a online crypto gambling game built on the SUI Blockchain using the SUI Python Client SDK (Called PySUI - https://github.com/FrankC01/pysui ). This game was beautifully illustrated in Microsoft Paint to provide an immersive user experience for all players.

Player characters are alligators and the goal of the game is to eat more fish than the competition. Players begin the game by entering their SUI wallet active-addresses and placing their bets. Verification checks are run to ensure that all players have sent in their bets and the game commences. Players turn and maneuver through the pond to eat the delicious fish. After the last fish is chomped up, a winner is determined and paid out the money pot. Players then return to the title screen for instant replay opportunity!
